## Loading and preprocessing the data
activity = read.csv("C:/Users/ginna.robayo/Desktop/GINA PERSONAL/COURSERA/specdata/activity.csv")

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
total_of_steps_of_day <- sum(activity$steps, na.rm = TRUE)

##the total number of steps per day is
total_of_steps_of_day
[1] 570608

##If you do not understand the difference between a histogram and a barplot, research the difference between them. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day##

## Calculating the total number of steps taken each day and stored in a variable
total_steps_per_day <- aggregate(steps~date, data=activity, FUN=sum, na.rm=TRUE)

## Generating the Histogram by each day
hist(total_steps_per_day$steps)

##Calculating the mean and median

> total_steps_each_perday_median <- median(total_steps_each_day$steps)
> total_steps_each_perday_mean <- mean(total_steps_each_day$steps)

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
